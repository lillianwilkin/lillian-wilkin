            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2019, my mother and I opened an ice cream shop together in Lincoln, Illinois. The shop, Top Hat Creamery, allowed me to express my creativity in different ways; drawing the logo, painting the signature mural at the back of the shop, and designing the restaurant's interior. Here, I was able to test the waters by organizing events like National Ice Cream for Breakfast Day, vend at several festivals and weddings, and generate press through radio interviews, local news stations, and tourism websites. Although I have moved away, opening and operating Top Hat Creamery is what made me realize that I have a passion for cultivating spaces that provide a sense of community.</p>
            <p>Since moving to New Orleans, I have channeled that creativity into photography, costuming, and organizing community-centered events. This started with hosting a series of shows with the former collective Safe and Sound, which aimed to uplift the voices of female and gender-nonconforming musicians. The DIY aspect of Safe and Sound's shows provided a sense of intimacy, for both the performers and audience, allowing for experimentation with artistic expression. </p>
            <p>Earlier this year, I became an administrator for f/504, a creative collective that emphasizes the importance of free and accessible networking and collaborative events to help people hone in on their artistic skills. f/504 aims to spread love for photography, music, digital media, modeling, and fashion in a safe environment for creatives of all ages and skillsets, in different venues around New Orleans.</p>
            <p>Recent projects of mine include costuming the music video "Water" by Wild Roots Rising, and planning Keep The Greenway Green, a community music festival where the video debuted, and proceeds were donated to the Louisiana Himilaya Association and Pelican Gardens. Regardless of the setting, I strive to create an environment where artists of any kind feel comfortable expressing themselves. </p>
